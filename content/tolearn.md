Some things in my "to-learn" list:

- Gaming
- [Japanese studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_studies)  
  Like many otakus, it all started with "I want to understand anime without subtitles" for me. Thanks to [Anki](https://ankiweb.net/) and [Remembering the Kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembering_the_Kanji_and_Remembering_the_Hanzi), I have been able to maintain a good pace.
- [Ambidexterity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambidexterity)  
  This has improved a lot because of cubing but my handwriting with non-dominant hand still needs a lot of work.
- Memory tricks  
  I want to work on my personal [mind palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci) when I get the time to.
- Card tricks and [cardistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardistry)  
  I like mathematical tricks that "just work" more than sleight of hand but cardistry certainly seems cool.
- Animation
- Drawing/Painting
- Juggling
- Yoyoing
- Harmonica/Guitar/Music theory
- Origami
- Penmanship
- Woodworking

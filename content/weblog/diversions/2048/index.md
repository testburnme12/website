### The only strategies you need to learn

- Put the highest tile in a corner. I prefer choosing the top left corner but it's irrelevent to the overall strategy.

- Keep the row with the highest tile filled at all times.

- Only move your highest corner tile when forced to, then immediately return it.

  Now, there will be cases when the corner will be replaced with a small tile but that doesn't mean it's the end of the game. It will just make your position a little weaker and decrease your chances of getting a very high score. Nevertheless, getting a 2048 should not be a problem if you follow the above steps.

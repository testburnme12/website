## Tactics and strategy

- Chess is 90% tactics, and you need to know these fundamental tactical patterns.
  - Fork / Double attack - a piece attacks multiple enemy pieces simultaneously.
  - Pin - a defending piece cannot move without exposing a more valuable defending piece.
  - Skewer - like pin, but more valuable piece is under attack.
  - Discovery - a direct attack revealed when one piece moves out of the way of another.
  - Discovered check - a discovery that comes with a check.
- The basic checkmate patterns often occur at the end or as the climax of many tactical combinations. They are:
  - Smothered mate
  - Support checkmate
  - Back-rank mate
- "Tactics are the servant of strategy" - Mikhail Botvinik
- A good piece leads to good tactics:
  1. How many squares does my piece control?
  2. Is it safe?
- Long term "strategical plans" are based on recognizing and attacking pawn weaknesses:
  - Doubled pawns
  - Isolated pawns
  - Backward pawns

## Endgame

- Two factors dictate the play of all roughly equal endgames:
  1. King play and power
  2. Passed pawns
- "In the middlegame, the king is but a mere extra but in the endgame, the king is a principal." - Aaron Nimzowitsch
- Activate your king at the earlist oppportunity.
- Use your king to help protect your passed pawns as they advance.
- Remember "king on the 6th, pawn on the 5th".
- "Pawns are the soul of chess." - Danican Philidor
- Recognize the potential of your pawn majorities.
- Remember:
  - Protected passed pawns,
  - Outside passed pawns,
  - And... push, push, push your passed pawns to victory!

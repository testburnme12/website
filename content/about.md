Hi, I'm <Link to="">@rsapkf</Link>, a programmer. Thanks for stopping by my homepage on the World Wide Web!

I mainly do full-stack web development with the MERN stack, Django, PostgreSQL, and the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org). Other technologies that I use on a regular/semi-regular basis can be found <Link to="/uses/">here</Link>. I am also interested in [theoretical computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_computer_science) and [\*nix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like) systems.

I was born [~ 978307200](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=unix+time+978307200) seconds after the Unix epoch. As a [perfectionist](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfectionism_(psychology)#Normal_vs._neurotic>) inspired by [autodidacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodidacticism) and [polymaths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath), I try to learn what I find interesting and share as much as I can.
